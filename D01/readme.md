## Day 1: Introduction to NLP and Text Analysis
09:00-10:30 Lucija Krusic (Univ. Graz): Python programming course for novice participant (technical)

Obligatory for Novice participants

This course introduces novice participants to the fundamentals of Python programming, covering topics such as data types, control structures, functions, and basic libraries. Participants will learn to write simple Python scripts and programs, enabling them to solve NLP-related problems through hands-on projects and exercises.

10:30-11:00 Coffee Break

11:00-12:30 Klara Venglarova (Univ. Graz): Introduction to NLP Methods

Obligatory for Novice participants

What are types and tokens? What role does a lemmatizer play? How can computers recognize names in text? This introductory course on Natural Language Processing (NLP) covers fundamental concepts and includes practical exercises to deepen your understanding.

12:30-13:30 Lunch Break

13:30-15:00 Stefanie Dipper (Ruhr-Universität Bochum): Corpus Building

This session makes introductions to corpora and annotations, including the importance of various annotation types and methodologies for enhancing linguistic research through automated tools, with a focus on enhancing the usability and accuracy of linguistic data.

15:00-15:30 Coffee Break

15:30-17:00 Tamás Kovács (Univ. Graz): Introduction into our Working Environment (Colab, Data sets)

This introductory session will familiarize participants with our primary working environment, Google Colab, including how to access and manipulate datasets within this cloud-based platform. We will explore basic features of Colab notebooks, discuss data importation techniques, and demonstrate effective ways to interact with datasets to kickstart data-driven projects.

17:00-17:30 Coffee Break

17:30 – Jean-Baptiste Camps (École Nationale des Chartes): Computational Methods and Medieval Manuscripts (Keynote)

The written culture of Antiquity and the Middle Ages has been transmitted to us mostly through handwritten documents. Contrarily to a widespread idea, a substantial part of it remains poorly known. Today, computational methods offer new windows into the cultures of the past:artificial intelligence allows to quickly transcribe and annotate vast collections of manuscripts, while quantitative analysis sheds light on the origin of the texts. In the future, methods akin to those of evolutionary biology or ecology could help understanding the macro-evolutionary processes leading to the survival or extinction of past works of literature and of wide swathes of our human cultural heritage.
