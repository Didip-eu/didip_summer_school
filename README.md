# ‚ÄúComputational Language Technologies for Medievalists‚Äù Summer School üèñÔ∏è ‚òÄÔ∏è

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Summer School on Computational Language Technologies for Medievalists, held in Graz from July 8-12, 2024. This repository contains the learning materials, Jupyter notebooks, and various datasets used throughout the program.

## Objectives

The Summer School aims to equip students and scholars at the graduate, doctoral, and postdoctoral levels with essential skills in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its applications in medieval studies. The program offers a hands-on approach, providing practical tools and resources to enhance research in this specialized area. The summer school will select 20+2 participants, divided into four groups with varying levels of Python programming knowledge, fostering a collaborative and enriching learning environment.

## Structure and Data Organization
### Daily Themes

    D1: Python crash course, Introduction
    D2: Topic Modeling
    D3: Named Entity Detection
    D4: Stylometry and Text Reuse
    D5: Large Language Models (LLM)

### Data Directories

    Specific data for each day‚Äôs theme should be stored in the corresponding data directory (e.g., data/D2_topic_modeling).
    Widely usable data should be stored in the DATA directory.

### Naming Conventions

    Use the format D{day}{theme}_S{session_number}_{task_description} to keep folders organized (e.g., D2_TM_S3_task_01_identify_common_themes).
