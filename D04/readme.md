Day 4: Text Reuse and Authorship Analysis

- Jeroen de Gussem (Univ. Gent): Text Reuse / Stylometry
- with Tamás Kovács, Teaching Assistants: Bernhard Bauer, Florian Atzenhofer-Baumgartner, Niklas Tscherne, Nicolas Renet, Klara Venglarova
- This course module will cover text reuse and authorship analysis, focusing on techniques to detect instances of text borrowing and to determine authorship in various texts. Students will explore algorithms such as cosine similarity, Jaccard index, and stylometric analysis, applying these methods to literary works and academic papers to identify patterns of reuse and attribute texts to their likely authors.
