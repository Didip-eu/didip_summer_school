    "# 4. Supervised Analysis and Classifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised algorithms (or **supervised** models) observe the way in which the feature inputs `X` (e.g. function word frequencies of known texts) correlate with class outputs `y` (e.g. authorship / label of the text). A supervised model ‘observes’ correctly labelled, preclassified X-y pairs, in order to register meaningful correlations (e.g. between certain function word patterns X with certain authors y). This process is called ‘training,’ and the X-y pairs which the model trains on correspond to what is commonly referred to as `training data`. Consequently, once this learning process has taken place, the model can be confronted with `test data,` comprising previously unobserved and unclassified texts. On the basis of what it has observed, the supervised model can make a prediction (classification), and assign the unseen test data to a class, either by a hard decision or by outputting a probability score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification is a considerable field of research on its own. There are **many types** of classifiers, and it is not always clear which one will perform best, and why. Varying types of classifiers tend to react differently to different problems, have a variety of parametrization options and require other methods by which to optimize their performance during training. A big advantage of supervised machine-learning methods, ‘text classification’ (Sebastiani 2002), is the **possibility of evaluation**. By making different combinations of parameters, such as the feature set, the vector length (number of features), sample length, vectorization method, scaling method, etc., and evaluating how well they can be fitted to a class (author), scholars can finetune and optimize these parameters.\n",
    "Before we proceed, we **repeat**, with the block of code below, some of **the steps from the previous notebook**.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Loading and segmentation of documents, containers `authors`, `titles`, `texts`\n",
    "2. Vectorization of `texts` to matrix `X` containing vectors for all text segments\n",
    "3. Scale `X` by applying `StandardScaler()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, as opposed to the three previous notebooks, we are now introducing a **test corpus** of allegedly **unknown authorship**. These files can be found in our `'corpus/test/'` folder. Below, we will apply a classifier to attribute the text to one of the **known classes**, i.e. our training set from the `'corpus/train/'` folder."

    "## 4.1 Training a Classifier (by applying SVM)\n",
    "\n",
    "Especially in recent years, that have witnessed the rise of machine learning and computing power,  classification algorithms such as support vector machines (SVM’s, **support vector machines**) have become increasingly popular. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the optimal hyperplane that maximally separates data points of different classes in a high-dimensional space. SVM is effective in high-dimensional spaces and is versatile with different kernel functions for non-linear classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, we will not occupy ourselves too much with the hyperparameters of SVM's just yet, and first take a look at some more general principles of training and evaluating classifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1.1 Preparing the Dataset for Training → `train_test_split`\n",
    "\n",
    "Above, we already declared a train and test set in separate folders. During training, however, it is considered good practice to hold out a **development set** (`X_dev`), also known as a **validation set**. It is a subset of the training set that is set aside during the training of a machine learning model. This heldout `X_dev` is not used in the training process but is instead used to evaluate the model's performance during development. The heldout dev set allows you to assess how well your model is likely to perform on unseen data (i.e. `X_test`), providing a better estimate of its generalization ability, offering a basis for tuning hyperparameters by evaluating different settings, detecting overfitting early to take preventive measures, and aiding in selecting the best performing model for production.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a list of the variables that you will encounter in the process of partitioning our data set:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `X_train` and `y_train`: The **full training set**: all vectorized text segments (`X_train`) labelled by authorship (`y_train`).\n",
    "* `X_train_split` and `y_train_split`: The **remaining training set** after subtraction of the validation set.\n",
    "* `X_dev` and `y_dev`: The **validation set**, subset of the training data  temporarily held out in order to function as a kind of stand-in test set.\n",
    "* `X_test`:  The *actual* **test set**, i.e. texts unseen by the model, for which authorship are —truly, this time— unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters to take into account when subtracting `X_dev` from `X_train` are the **split ratio** (`test_size=0.33`) and a **random seed** in the split process to ensure that the results are reproducible (`random_state`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1.2 Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 score\n",
    "\n",
    "Once our model is trained on `X_train_split` and known labels `y_train_split`, we are effectively able to test the model's quality by having it predict on the heldout `X_dev` set. This yields a vector of **predictions** `y_dev_pred`, which can be readily compared to what is commonly referred to as \"**ground truth**\" or \"**gold standard**\".\n",
    "\n",
    "During training, each of our authors (let's say for now, authors A, B, and C) is awarded a class label corresponding to a digit, e.g. `0`, `1`, `2`. \n",
    "- The `y_dev`-array will, therefore, look like something like this: `[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]`, where each of 3 authors in the training set is corresponded by 2 text samples in the development set.  \n",
    "- Possibly, our model can output as prediction (`y_dev_pred`) the vector array `[0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, it has made a mistake in misattributing the second text segment to class `1` (Author B) instead of class `0` (Author A).\n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing the golden standard against the predictions, we can extract several interesting evaluation metrics from a `classification_report`, yielding `accuracy`, `precision`, `recall`,`f1-score`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `accuracy`: *\"How often did we correctly attribute the text segment to a given author?\"*  \n",
    "  I.e. the percentage of correct predictions out of all the predictions made. The answer in our case may be obvious: 5 out of 6 times, 0.83.\n",
    "* `precision`: *\"When we positively identified a text segment as written by a given author, how often was that true?\"*  \n",
    "  Precision is calculated for each class separately and later averaged across classes. In our case, let us consider the example of Author B. In case of Authors A and C, the precision is in fact 100% in both cases: all positive identifications (1/1 for Author A and 2/2 for Author B) were indeed positive. In case of Author B, however, at one time `1` flared up where the outcome should have been `0` (= Author A). This is a **false positive**, and impairs our model's precision to 2/3 —out of 3 positive outcomes for Author B, only 2 were in fact correct—, and yields a score of 0.67. On average, our precision (when macro-averaged across all classes) is 0.89.\n",
    "* `recall`: *\"Were we able to attribute all text segments of a given author to that author?\"*  \n",
    "  Recall computes how many out of all predictions that should have been labelled positive were actually labelled such. Again, each class is first looked at individually. It turns out that, when we indeed look at the example of Author A, we in fact only caught half of the `0`'s we should have caught, because we falsely attributed an observation belonging to `0` to class `1`. The missed instance for class `0` is what we call a **false negative**, and impairs the recall for that class to 1/2, i.e. 0.5. For Authors B and C, the results are 2/2 and 2/2, both times 100%. Taken on average, then, when looking at our model's performance on all authors, the so-called macro recall adds up to 0.83.\n",
    "* `f1-score`: A balanced score (harmonic mean) that combines precision and recall."

    "Consequently, by using `GridSearchCV()`, one can efficiently navigate through the classifier's parameter space. Moreover, we expand its functionality in the code to follow by introducing a number of implementations particularly suitable for non-traditional authorship attribution. The code block below is an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Preprocessing**: First, we open and preprocess our files again (a step you are familiar with by now), and store our `texts` (text segments by a certain `sample_len`) in a variable `X_train`. Consequently, we label the segments by authorship and store the labels in `y_train` (if there are three authors, the labels should be `0` for author A, `1` for author B, and `2` for author C).\n",
    "2. **Vectorization**: We initialize various vectorization options, where we take into account the feature type (`word` or `char`), declare our `n_gram` preferences, and decide whether we want to input raw frequencies (`CountVectorizer()`) or else TF-IDF frequencies (`TfidfVectorizer`).\n",
    "3. **Pipeline and Parameter Grid**: We build a `pipe` (`Pipeline`) a tool for chaining together these data preprocessing steps and machine learning algorithms into a single object. This enables seamless and efficient handling of data transformation and model training, facilitating the creation of end-to-end machine learning workflows. We store our variables in a dictionary `param_grid`, specifying the hyperparameter values to search over during the grid search. It allows for systematic exploration of different combinations of hyperparameters to identify the optimal configuration for a machine learning model.\n",
    "4. **Grid Search and Cross-Validated Results**: Finally, we introduce a new important concept, that of cross-Validation (CV). In fact, CV is an advanced and more reliable way of going about `train_test_split` as it was introduced in the block of code earlier. With CV, the dataset is divided into *k* equal-sized **folds**. Consequently, the model is trained *k* times, where each time it is trained on *k*−1 folds (which corresponds to `X_train_split` above) and tested on the remaining fold (`X_dev`). The performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score) are averaged over the *k* trials to give a more reliable estimate of the model's performance (information you can extract from `results['mean_test_accuracy_score']`).\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps ensure that the model is not overly dependent on a particular subset of the data, as well as provides a more accurate estimate of the model’s performance on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to tweak the various parameter settings above, and then run the code below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Searching many parameters at the same time can be quite costly and take a long time. Try to start your gridsearch by focussing on only a few of these parameters at a time, just so you can get acquainted with them.**"
