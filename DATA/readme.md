# Dataset Overview

## mom_1000_sample.tsv

This dataset is a sample of 1000 entries (500 German (dialect/era not diffenciated), 500 Latin) from a larger collection of historical texts, potentially charters. It provides a rich resource for various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, particularly in the context of historical text analysis and teaching. This sample includes machine-translated abstracts in English, adding another dimension for NLP exploration.

## Dataset Structure

The dataset is stored in a tab-separated values (TSV) file named `mom_1000_sample.tsv`. Each row represents a single text entry, and the columns provide metadata and content information:

| Column Name                   | Description                                                               | Data Type |
| :---------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------- |
| `atom_id`                     | Unique identifier for each text entry (e.g., "_AT-StiAG/GoettweigOSB/1402_IV_13_"	)                                    | Object   |
| `place`                       | Location associated with the text entry (if available, e.g., "_Rom_")                    | Object   |
| `year`                        | Year the text entry was created (e.g., "_1402_")                                           | Int64    |
| `lang`                        | Language of the text ('_lat_' for Latin, '_de_' for German)                    | Object   |
| `text`                        | Full text content (e.g., "_Bonifatius episcopus, servus servorum dei, ad futuram rei memoriam. Sincere devocionis affectus,_" ...)                                                           | Object   |
| `abstract`                    | Abstract or summary of the text (in original language)                    | Object   |
| `abstract_lang`               | Language of the abstract ("_de_" for German, "_lat_" for Latin)               | Object   |
| `translated_abstract_opus`    | Machine-translated version of the abstract with Opus (in English) e.g. "_Pope Bonifaz IX confirms to GÃ¶ttweig the right to hire to the incorporated parish Mautern..._"                | Object   |

* There are marginal missing values in the dataset.
* The datatypes are suitable for the respective columns.
* The languages of the texts are either Latin (`lat`) or German (`de`), and the abstracts are predominantly in German (`de`).
* The years range from 816 to 1752, representing a broad historical time frame.
* The dataset includes a new column `translated_abstract_opus` with English translations of the abstracts.

## vulgate_sample_1000.tsv

This dataset is a sample of 1000 entries extracted from the Latin Vulgate Bible, a late 4th-century Latin translation of the Bible.

# Dataset Overview: `mom_1000_sample.tsv`

This dataset is a sample of 1000 entries extracted from the Latin Vulgate Bible, a late 4th-century Latin translation of the Bible. It provides a valuable resource for various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, particularly in the context of historical text analysis and teaching. This sample includes both the original Latin text and English translations, opening avenues for multilingual NLP exploration.

## Dataset Structure

The dataset is stored in a tab-separated values (TSV) file named `mom_1000_sample.tsv`. Each row represents a single excerpt from the Vulgate Bible, and the columns provide metadata and content information:

| Column Name                   | Description                                                                                     | Data Type |
| :---------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------- |
| `id`                     | Unique identifier for each text entry                                                          | Object   |
| `text`                        | Original Latin text excerpt from the Vulgate                                                    | Object   |
```

**Initial Observations:**

* There are no missing values in the dataset.
* The datatypes are suitable for the respective columns.


## Applications

1.  **Topic Modeling:**
    *   Explore topic modeling techniques across three languages (Latin, German, and English).
    *   Compare topics extracted from original texts, original language abstracts, and translated abstracts.
    *   Analyze potential shifts in topics introduced by machine translation.

2.  **Named Entity Recognition (NER):**
    *   Evaluate and compare NER performance on original language texts and translated abstracts.
    *   Investigate how translation affects entity recognition and extraction.

3.  **Stylometry/Text Reuse:**
    *   Assess how machine translation impacts stylometric features and authorship attribution.
    *   Explore cross-lingual text reuse detection using both original and translated texts.

4.  **Large Language Models (LLMs):**
    *   Fine-tune LLMs on this multilingual dataset for tasks like text generation, translation, and summarization.
    *   Evaluate and improve machine translation models using the available translations.

5.  **Machine Translation Evaluation:**
    *   Use the dataset to assess the quality of the provided machine translations.
    *   Develop metrics to evaluate translation accuracy and fluency in a historical context.
