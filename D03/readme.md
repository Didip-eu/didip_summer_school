# Day 3: Named Entity Recognition

Ismail **Prada** (Univ. Bern): Named Entity Recognition
- with Sandy **Aoun** and Selina **Galka**
  - Teaching Assistants: Roman **Bleier**, Florian **Atzenhofer-Baumgartner**, Niklas **Tscherne**, Nicolas **Renet**, Klara **Venglarova**

## Overview

This day-long session at the NLP for Medievalists School focuses on the topic of Named Entity Recognition (NER) for historical texts, particularly medieval documents. The session is covering the following topics:

1. **General Introduction**
   - Brief history of NER techniques, from rule-based to unsupervised and supervised approaches.

2. **WHAT: What is a Named Entity?**
   - Definitions and categories of named entities.
   - Challenges in handling flat vs. nested named entities.
   - Group discussion on annotation guidelines for various medieval corpora.

3. **WHY: Why Do We Do Named Entity Recognition?**
   - Why do we do NER? - Information Extraction: Relation Extraction, Event Extraction, Coreference Resolution, Named Entity Linking, Knowledge Base Population
   - Overview of existing annotation toolkits (Transkribus, Inception, Doccano)
   - Hands-on session on creating annotated data.
      - Inception invitation link: http://157.230.123.17:8080/p/summerschool/join-project/pDzNJc7l-V7qx7eP4jEk4w

4. **HOW: What is Named Entity Recognition?**
   - Specific challenges in historical NER.
   - Supervised sequence-to-sequence models (Flair, spaCy, Transformers) and their advantages/disadvantages.
   - Evaluation metrics beyond just recall and precision.
   - Hands-on session on fine-tuning NER models on historical data.

## Showcases

- Information Extraction from German Medieval Charters Abstracts
- Active Learning + NER for French Texts 
- NER on Historical German and Ottoman Turkish Corpora 

## Hands-On Sessions

- Creating annotated data for NER
- Adopting and fine-tuning existing NER frameworks (Flair, spaCy) on historical corpora
- Applying NER models to participants' own data
