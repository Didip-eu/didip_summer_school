Ismail Prada (Univ. Bern): Named Entity Recognition
- with Sandy Aoun and Selina Galka, Teaching Assistants: Roman Bleier, Florian Atzenhofer-Baumgartner, Niklas Tscherne, Nicolas Renet, Klara Venglarova
- This session will explore Named Entity Recognition (NER), a crucial technique in natural language processing that identifies and classifies named entities in text into predefined categories such as persons, organizations, locations, and others. Participants will learn to implement and train NER models using popular libraries like spaCy and NLTK, and apply these models to extract structured information from unstructured text data.
