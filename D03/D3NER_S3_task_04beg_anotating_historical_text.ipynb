Are there any detected \"names\" that aren't actually person names?\n","- The challenges of historical named entity recognition, such as archaic names or titles that modern models might not recognize.\n","- The importance of context in identifying person names in historical texts.\n","- This approach provides a good balance between manual annotation and automated detection, allowing for a more comprehensive identification of person names in the text. It can be easily expanded to include other types of named entities or applied to larger historical texts."],"metadata":{"id":"sI25pHrn-qoi"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"4dKrkL8a-dWZ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1720102780084,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":16157,"user":{"displayName":"Tamas","userId":"07327650368274908773"}},"outputId":"e3f5da1b-9a59-499a-e194-cb4036c825b9"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Sample Historical Text:\n","\n","A.D. 871.
